# Requirements
## Hardware
* OpenGL 4.3 capable GPU (and drivers)
* 1 GB Graphics Memory

### Motion controller
Currently these options are supported:

* Wii Remote with a MotionPlus attachment. A sensor bar is also strongly recommended (the game will run without but there will be severe gyroscopic yaw drift).

Note that Wii Remote support may be discontinued at some point in favor of OpenVR and mobile devices, at which point there'll be another look at license options, too.

## Software
* Python 3.6 or later

# Installation
* pip install -r requirements.txt

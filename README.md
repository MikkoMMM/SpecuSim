# Requirements
## Hardware
* OpenGL 4.3 capable GPU (and drivers)
* 1 GB Graphics Memory

### Motion controller
Currently these options are supported:

* Wii Remote with a MotionPlus attachment. A sensor bar is also strongly recommended (the game will run without but there will be severe gyroscopic yaw drift).

## Software
* Currently Python 3.8 or later is required. (Python 3.6 and 3.7 support is planned)

# Installation
* pip install -r requirements.txt

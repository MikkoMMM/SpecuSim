# Contributing
We do accept contributions, but there's currently very little English guidance on the project's goals. So probably talk first before trying to submit major changes.

All changes must be compatible with the MIT License. Indicate whether the work is your own. If it isn't, please write where you got the code snippet from, its license, and any necessary information required by the license to NOTICE.txt.


## Style guide
These are general guidelines for the code style conventions in this project. Use some common sense regarding how strictly to adhere to these.

For other matters, if you are used to the PEP8 style, use that.

Some basics are:

A level of indentation uses 4 spaces.

Naming conventions are:
* .py file names should be short and all-lowercase
* joined_lower for functions, methods, attributes and variables
* ALL_CAPS for constants
* CapWords for classes

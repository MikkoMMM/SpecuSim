1.1.2021 Development was started. Contrary to previous plans, Java probably isn't going to be used (unless I make optional modules). A preliminary requirements.txt was created.
4.1.2021 Tested out the Ursina and Panda3D engines somewhat
5.1.2021 Looked at various Wii Remote libraries. Studied about the Boost library. Formulated a plan to later on relicense by moving on to OpenVR, but for now have the license be GPL. Some learning about using the Cwiid library.
7.1.2021 Made a test about the interoperability between Panda3D and Cwiid
8.1.2021 Reading up on inertial sensors
9.1.2021 More research on how to get orientation and positional information from the Wiimote. Trying to calibrate the Wii Remote for the micropython-fusion library. Studied the Attitude-Estimation library.
10.1.2021 A breakthrough: accurate orientation measurements with micropython-fusion (no yaw, of course, though).
11.1.2021 Calculating the heading information for a Wiimote. The orientation measurements now control the camera in test.py. Also, there's now a Wiimote calibration phase.
12.1.2021 Reading up on the terrain capabilities of Panda3D and implementing some traversable terrain. Reorganizing the directory structure. Trying out the Render Pipeline and learning about its terrain capabilities.
13.1.2021 Started the work on including Render Pipeline. The Wiimote connection is now done asynchronously, too. README was also updated somewhat.
14.1.2021 Moved the Wiimote code to its own file. The Render Pipeline is now used for showing the terrain. The motion controls are now much more accurate as well, due to them being handled asynchronously and the GyroMeansError having been lowered. An additional instruction that the Wiimote must be face up during calibration was added.
15.1.2021 Looking into how one would add water to the scene and trying to do it. Made the heading resetting less aggressive.
16.1.2021 Looking into how to change textures programmatically in Render Pipeline.
17.1.2021 Attempting to implement the oceans once more
19.1.2021 Made unit models of basic geometric shapes. Also more attempts at texturing. Found out that Render Pipeline was perhaps even a mistake; it was a matter of changing one number in a shader to get the terrain texturing to work properly in regular Panda3D.
20.1.2021 Reading up on models and actors for Panda3D. Trying out the basics of the Bullet physics engine. Resized the unit models.
22.1.2021 Simplified the keyboard control code and some more Bullet basics. Looking at generative music models available for Python.
24.1.2021 Some camera positioning code and trying to figure out movements still.
26.1.2021 Email exchanging with the supervisor (1h). Writing up a project plan. A Trello page.
27.1.2021 The camera now follows player's rotations too. Trying to solve what causes so much unintended rotation for the player character, and making a quick and dirty patch for it. Apparently the problem is called Internal Edge Collision. Implementing a ground collision ray test and seeing what it's good for.
28.1.2021 More reading up on a custom character controller implementation. Making it possible to control the camera with the mouse in a sane manner.
29.1.2021 Considering the directory structure. Began work on the Animal class.
30.1.2021 Pondering how to make the Animal class generalizable but simple. Attempting to make a controllable hinge constraint.
31.1.2021 Instead of an Animal class, there's probably going to be a Humanoid. Some more groundwork for it.
3.2.2021 Trying to get the collisions and constraints to work somewhat coherently between body parts and the ground.
4.2.2021 Researching body proportions and implementing some. A script that tracks when files were modified, to help with tracking activity. Divided the torso up to a chest and a lower torso, and tweaked some dimensions and constraints.
5.2.2021 A second leg, and started working on more finalized walking. The leg has been split into a thigh, a lower leg and a foot, with constraints between each.

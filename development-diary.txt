1.1.2021 Development was started. Contrary to previous plans, Java probably isn't going to be used (unless I make optional modules). A preliminary requirements.txt was created.
4.1.2021 Tested out the Ursina and Panda3D engines somewhat
5.1.2021 Looked at various Wii Remote libraries. Studied about the Boost library. Formulated a plan to later on relicense by moving on to OpenVR, but for now have the license be GPL. Some learning about using the Cwiid library.
7.1.2021 Made a test about the interoperability between Panda3D and Cwiid
8.1.2021 Reading up on inertial sensors
9.1.2021 More research on how to get orientation and positional information from the Wiimote. Trying to calibrate the Wii Remote for the micropython-fusion library. Studied the Attitude-Estimation library.
10.1.2021 A breakthrough: accurate orientation measurements with micropython-fusion (no yaw, of course, though).
11.1.2021 Calculating the heading information for a Wiimote. The orientation measurements now control the camera in test.py. Also, there's now a Wiimote calibration phase.
12.1.2021 Reading up on the terrain capabilities of Panda3D and implementing some traversable terrain. Reorganizing the directory structure. Trying out the Render Pipeline and learning about its terrain capabilities.
13.1.2021 Started the work on including Render Pipeline. The Wiimote connection is now done asynchronously, too. README was also updated somewhat.
14.1.2021 Moved the Wiimote code to its own file. The Render Pipeline is now used for showing the terrain. The motion controls are now much more accurate as well, due to them being handled asynchronously and the GyroMeansError having been lowered. An additional instruction that the Wiimote must be face up during calibration was added.
15.1.2021 Looking into how one would add water to the scene and trying to do it. Made the heading resetting less aggressive.

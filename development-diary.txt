1.1.2021 Development was started. Contrary to previous plans, Java probably isn't going to be used (unless I make optional modules). A preliminary requirements.txt was created.
4.1.2021 Tested out the Ursina and Panda3D engines somewhat
5.1.2021 Looked at various Wii Remote libraries. Studied about the Boost library. Formulated a plan to later on relicense by moving on to OpenVR, but for now have the license be GPL. Some learning about using the Cwiid library.
7.1.2021 Made a test about the interoperability between Panda3D and Cwiid
8.1.2021 Reading up on inertial sensors
9.1.2021 More research on how to get orientation and positional information from the Wiimote. Trying to calibrate the Wii Remote for the micropython-fusion library. Studied the Attitude-Estimation library.
10.1.2021 A breakthrough: accurate orientation measurements with micropython-fusion (no yaw, of course, though).
11.1.2021 Calculating the heading information for a Wiimote. The orientation measurements now control the camera in test.py. Also, there's now a Wiimote calibration phase.
12.1.2021 Reading up on the terrain capabilities of Panda3D and implementing some traversable terrain. Reorganizing the directory structure. Trying out the Render Pipeline and learning about its terrain capabilities.
13.1.2021 Started the work on including Render Pipeline. The Wiimote connection is now done asynchronously, too. README was also updated somewhat.
14.1.2021 Moved the Wiimote code to its own file. The Render Pipeline is now used for showing the terrain. The motion controls are now much more accurate as well, due to them being handled asynchronously and the GyroMeansError having been lowered. An additional instruction that the Wiimote must be face up during calibration was added.
15.1.2021 Looking into how one would add water to the scene and trying to do it. Made the heading resetting less aggressive.
16.1.2021 Looking into how to change textures programmatically in Render Pipeline.
17.1.2021 Attempting to implement the oceans once more
19.1.2021 Made unit models of basic geometric shapes. Also more attempts at texturing. Found out that Render Pipeline was perhaps even a mistake; it was a matter of changing one number in a shader to get the terrain texturing to work properly in regular Panda3D.
20.1.2021 Reading up on models and actors for Panda3D. Trying out the basics of the Bullet physics engine. Resized the unit models.
22.1.2021 Simplified the keyboard control code and some more Bullet basics. Looking at generative music models available for Python.
24.1.2021 Some camera positioning code and trying to figure out movements still.
26.1.2021 Email exchanging with the supervisor (1h). Writing up a project plan. A Trello page.
27.1.2021 The camera now follows player's rotations too. Trying to solve what causes so much unintended rotation for the player character, and making a quick and dirty patch for it. Apparently the problem is called Internal Edge Collision. Implementing a ground collision ray test and seeing what it's good for.
28.1.2021 More reading up on a custom character controller implementation. Making it possible to control the camera with the mouse in a sane manner.
29.1.2021 Considering the directory structure. Began work on the Animal class.
30.1.2021 Pondering how to make the Animal class generalizable but simple. Attempting to make a controllable hinge constraint.
31.1.2021 Instead of an Animal class, there's probably going to be a Humanoid. Some more groundwork for it.
3.2.2021 Trying to get the collisions and constraints to work somewhat coherently between body parts and the ground.
4.2.2021 Researching body proportions and implementing some. A script that tracks when files were modified, to help with tracking activity. Divided the torso up to a chest and a lower torso, and tweaked some dimensions and constraints.
5.2.2021 A second leg, and started working on more finalized walking. The leg has been split into a thigh, a lower leg and a foot, with constraints between each.
8.2.2021 Starting up with code for stepping, and reading up on tasks and event handling in Panda3D.
9.2.2021 More work done on walking. Also sent a message to the supervisor and looked for inspiration from ragdoll physics.
10.2.2021 Walking forward and backward is now in a usable state. Researching how to implement sideways movement. Looking at some inverse kinematics and active ragdoll stuff.
11.2.2021 Converting the hip constraints to BulletGenericConstraints. Their motors work differently enough that it requires new trial and error finding how to make the walking work properly.
12.2.2021–13.2.2021 "Sick leave"; I had a food poisoning.
14.2.2021 Reminding myself where I left off
15.2.2021 Looking into how I'd like to implement sideways motion: walking in potentially an arbitrary direction requires different, likely more difficult, logic than WASD. Started implementing one possible approach. Considering what this all means regarding possible multiplayer prospects and about its implementation in general as well.
17.2.2021 Moving in an arbitrary direction was implemented. Also, a standing still animation (amazing, right?) A developer feature to change player speed on the fly. Some changes trying to make the movement happen more consistently early on.
18.2.2021 The turning code was revised and the player retains their heading now. Started "real work" on arms.
19.2.2021 The arms were finished and angular limits set. Mirroring left and right arms' limits also took some experimentation to find a good way. Also, for a moment it looked like there was a bug in the physics engine, which slowed down progress.
20.2.2021 The player character got a-head in life. Also, tweaked the proportions somewhat.
21.2.2021 Made it possible to set a humanoid's starting position
22.2.2021 Started out with player doppelgangers. Improved performance, and even took another look at alternative physics engines.
23.2.2021 Tested out possible physics multiprocessing and did more performance analysis. Started moving on to less frequent physics calculations.
24.2.2021 Attempting to figure out a new movement algorithm for the less frequent physics.
25.2.2021 Looking at various inverse kinematics options out there and more testing for a new movement algorithm.
26.2.2021 There's a kind-of workable walking algorithm again now. Looking into repositioning characters when they clip through the ground.
27.2.2021 More experimentation on how to get walking "right" in every physics calculation interval at the very least. A physics debug mode, and some work on hitboxes. Fixed standing still.
28.2.2021 A rounded box collision shape. Re-enabled some intra- and inter-body collisions. Combined feet with lower legs, and tried adjusting the movement system for the change once more. Removed the multithreading option; it doesn't seem worth the hassle for the time being.
1.3.2021 Started up with a menu, at first for just selecting a weapon controller.
3.3.2021 Finished with the control setup menu, for now.
4.3.2021 A sword, and started up with its movement.
6.3.2021 Some more work on sword movement.
7.3.2021 Forearm movement works reasonably but the same approach was noticed to not give satisfactory results for the sword's movements. Also read up on some more network code stuff.
9.3.2021 Trying out CCD-IK-Panda3D.
11.3.2021 Continued work on integrating CCD-IK-Panda3D.
12.3.2021 Refactoring IK parts and more integration of it. Planned what a mouse control method for a weapon might be like.

14.3.2021 More work done on the IK walking method.
15.3.2021 Making the IK method work better on inclines
16.3.2021 Collision with steep terrain and optimizing. A deceleration "animation".
17.3.2021 Returned the upper body as a ragdoll. Also some reading up on docstrings and deciding upon some style conventions and writing some information about contributing.
18.3.2021 Thought about which AI Dungeon fork to integrate. Started preparations for that. A speech bubble.
19.3.2021 Some work moving on to a new version of CCD-IK-Panda3D.
20.3.2021 Working on the GUI, and sending a message to the supervisor. Wrote a pull request template.

22.3.2021 Some form of collision for the ocean, a new camera controller, some cleanup and refactoring.
23.3.2021 The menu system was overhauled to be more general-purpose. Started integration of GPT2, and managed to get it to a state where it can generate text in speech bubbles.
24.3.2021 Some threaded loading stuff. Refactoring. Thinking about more ways to debug. Learning about asyncs, threading and multiprocessing.
25.3.2021 Some work on a system to thread GPT-2 calls.
26.3.2021 More work on an "NLP manager" (natural language processing manager). Removing some unused code, and minor tweaks.
27.3.2021 Getting and providing help with checking how GPU-support can be enabled in Pytorch on an AMD GPU. Comparing the code base of Clover Edition to others of its ilk. Attempting to "properly" fix a long-standing bug in Clover Edition, and by extention in SpecuSim's NLP.
28.3.2021 Took a bit of a detour to think about punny name generation for NPCs some time in the future. More refactoring and cleaning up of the GPT2 generator code and config, and made some progress defining stop characters.
29.3.2021 More control over text generation, and during-generation formatting.
30.3.2021 The speech bubble's hide timer now resets after new speech.
31.3.2021 Weighing the possibility of using GPT-Neo. Memory for NPCs. A better "memory merger".
2.4.2021 Contemplating the possibility of two player peer-to-peer multiplayer and its cyber security implications.
3.4.2021 Experimented with UDP networking, and made preparations for sending and receiving game state information. Made a "new" upper torso (except for arms) that's not physics-driven.
4.4.2021 Refactoring.
5.4.2021 The main executable's code was split into so-called "game modes". Now it works pretty much just as a launcher. Also, a connection dialog for PvP, and some work on its networking.
6.4.2021 More work on multiplayer.
7.4.2021 More testing on multiplayer and troubleshooting GLSL version support.
8.4.2021 Some work on integrating the new changes from the IK library. Thinking about how crowdfunding the project could work with Finland's taxation.

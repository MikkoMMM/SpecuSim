Model guidelines are available here:
https://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki/Model-Guidelines 

The convention used with "unit" models is that they are exactly as large as they can be to fit inside a 1x1x1 Blender units box. Typically default Blender objects are 2x2x2, so they have been halved in size.

The modelling can be done at least in Blender but you'll have to use a BAM exporting tool (such as blend2bam) for conversion to the BAM format.
